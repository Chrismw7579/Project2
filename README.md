Rendezvous

Rendezvous is a place where someone can find like minded people with common interests. A user can create an account and select interests from a list. When they go to their members page their availability can be toggle on. When the button 'Hangout" is pressed the site will give a list of 5 people in the same city who have the most common interests and are available. The user can then chat with those other members by clicking a chat button near their names. The site will persistently store up to 20 posts per chat room. This is usefull for people moving to a new area and want to connect, or just would like to find new people.
